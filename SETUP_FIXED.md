# Documentation Fixes Applied

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Port Configuration Conflicts ✅
**Problem**: The documentation showed inconsistent port configurations causing conflicts between API and frontend servers.
**Fix**: 
- API server now runs on port 3001 (configurable via PORT env var)
- Frontend React dev server runs on port 3000
- Updated all documentation to reflect correct ports
- Frontend proxy correctly configured to connect to API on port 3001

### 2. Environment Configuration Issues ✅
**Problem**: Missing required environment variables and unclear setup instructions.
**Fix**:
- Updated `.env.example` with better API key guidance
- Made Supabase configuration optional for basic testing
- Added clear instructions for obtaining Anthropic API keys
- Fixed environment variable examples in README

### 3. Setup Process Improvements ✅
**Problem**: Setup instructions were unclear and didn't handle common failure scenarios.
**Fix**:
- Made database setup optional (can run without Supabase)
- Improved step-by-step setup instructions
- Added verification steps for each component
- Clarified which dependencies are required vs optional

### 4. Missing Troubleshooting Documentation ✅
**Problem**: No guidance for common setup issues users encounter.
**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive troubleshooting section
- Documented common error messages and solutions
- Added verification commands for each service
